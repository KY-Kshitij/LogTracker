# CHANGES

## [2025-01-27 15:30] Phase A ¬∑ Step 0 ‚Äî Docs Bootstrap
**What we changed:**  
- Created `/docs` folder with complete documentation structure
- Initialized all required documentation files (CHANGES.md, PROGRESS.json, NEXT_STEP.md, LEARN.md, ASK_KB.md, DEBUG_PLAYBOOK.md, ROADMAP.md, ENV.md)
- Added `.env.example` files for both API and web apps
- Updated root README with docs reference

**How we implemented it (key points):**  
- Used templates provided in the requirements
- Set up machine-readable progress tracking in PROGRESS.json
- Created beginner-friendly learning cards with emojis
- Established Q&A knowledge base for Cursor "Ask" mode
- Added debug playbook for common issues

**Why this way (trade-offs & alternatives):**  
- Chosen: Comprehensive docs from day 1 to prevent knowledge loss and enable learning
- Not chosen: Minimal docs (because we want to teach and track progress systematically)

**Beginner explainers (with emojis):**  
- üß† Concept: Documentation as code - keeping docs in sync with actual changes  
- üîß Example: Every change gets a timestamped entry in CHANGES.md  
- ‚è±Ô∏è When to use: After every functional change, before moving to next step

**Verification (exact commands + expected):**  

```bash
ls -la docs/
```
Expected: 8 files created (CHANGES.md, PROGRESS.json, NEXT_STEP.md, LEARN.md, ASK_KB.md, DEBUG_PLAYBOOK.md, ROADMAP.md, ENV.md)

```bash
cat docs/PROGRESS.json
```
Expected: JSON with phase "A", step 0, status "initialized-docs"

```bash
ls -la apps/api/.env.example apps/web/.env.example
```
Expected: Both .env.example files exist

**Impact / Risks:**
- ‚úÖ No risks - pure documentation addition
- ‚úÖ Sets foundation for systematic development
- ‚úÖ Enables learning and debugging from day 1

**Follow-ups / TODO:**
- Phase A ¬∑ Step 1: Scaffold API with Express+TS, add /health endpoint
- Verify all docs are readable and helpful
- Test the development workflow

## [2025-01-27 15:50] Phase A ¬∑ Step 1 ‚Äî API Scaffold + /health
**What we changed:**  
- Upgraded API from basic Express to production-ready setup with Express 4.x, Pino logging, Helmet security, CORS, and Zod validation
- Added `/health` endpoint that returns `{ ok: true, version, uptime, timestamp, environment }`
- Implemented proper error handling middleware and 404 handler
- Added request logging and graceful shutdown handling
- Fixed port configuration (4000) and environment setup

**How we implemented it (key points):**  
- Used Express 4.18.2 for stability (avoided Express 5.x compatibility issues)
- Added Pino logger with pretty formatting for development
- Implemented Helmet for security headers and CORS for cross-origin requests
- Created structured health endpoint with uptime and version info
- Added comprehensive error handling and request logging

**Why this way (trade-offs & alternatives):**  
- Chosen: Express 4.x over 5.x (because of Node.js 18 compatibility and stability)
- Chosen: JavaScript over TypeScript initially (because of ts-node/esm loader issues)
- Not chosen: Express 5.x (because of path-to-regexp compatibility issues)
- Not chosen: TypeScript initially (because of loader configuration complexity)

**Beginner explainers (with emojis):**  
- üß† Concept: API health checks - endpoints that tell you if the service is running properly  
- üîß Example: `GET /health` ‚Üí `{ ok: true, uptime: 7.82, version: "1.0.0" }`  
- ‚è±Ô∏è When to use: Always have a health endpoint for monitoring and load balancers

**Verification (exact commands + expected):**  

```bash
pnpm --filter @api dev
```
Expected: Server starts with "üöÄ LogSaaS Lite API running on http://localhost:4000"

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/health
```
Expected: `{"ok":true,"version":"1.0.0","uptime":7.82,"timestamp":"2025-08-27T08:21:23.354Z","environment":"development"}`

```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/
```
Expected: `{"message":"LogSaaS Lite API","version":"1.0.0","status":"healthy","endpoints":{"health":"/health","docs":"/docs (coming soon)"}}`

**Impact / Risks:**
- ‚úÖ Production-ready API foundation established
- ‚úÖ Proper security headers and CORS configured
- ‚úÖ Structured logging for debugging and monitoring
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Using JavaScript instead of TypeScript (will upgrade in next phase)

**Follow-ups / TODO:**
- Phase A ¬∑ Step 2: Database models & indexes (Tenants, Projects, ApiKeys, Logs)
- Add TypeScript support once Node.js version is upgraded
- Implement database connection and models
- Add API key management endpoints

## [2025-01-27 16:30] Phase A ¬∑ Step 1.5 ‚Äî File Upload & Dashboard Integration
**What we changed:**  
- Fixed file upload functionality with proper API endpoint on port 4000
- Added real-time dashboard data tracking based on uploaded files
- Implemented file upload tracking with statistics (total files, file types, sizes)
- Enhanced dashboard with auto-refresh and manual refresh capabilities
- Added proper error handling and fallback data for dashboard

**How we implemented it (key points):**  
- Fixed API URL from port 3000 to 4000 in frontend components
- Added `/upload` endpoint with multer for file handling (10MB limit)
- Created `/data` endpoint that returns real statistics instead of random numbers
- Added in-memory file tracking with timestamps and metadata
- Enhanced dashboard UI with refresh button and last updated timestamp
- Added `/files` endpoint to view all uploaded files and statistics

**Why this way (trade-offs & alternatives):**  
- Chosen: In-memory storage for now (because MongoDB not set up yet)
- Chosen: Real file tracking over random numbers (because users expect consistent data)
- Chosen: Auto-refresh every 30 seconds (because real-time updates are expected)
- Not chosen: Database storage yet (because Phase A Step 2 is for database setup)
- Not chosen: Random mock data (because it confuses users)

**Beginner explainers (with emojis):**  
- üß† Concept: File upload tracking - storing metadata about uploaded files for analytics  
- üîß Example: Upload file ‚Üí increment counter ‚Üí dashboard shows real numbers  
- ‚è±Ô∏è When to use: Always track user actions to provide meaningful analytics

**Verification (exact commands + expected):**  

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
pnpm dev
```

```bash
# Test file upload
curl -X POST -F "file=@test.txt" http://localhost:4000/upload
```
Expected: `{"message":"File uploaded successfully","file":{"originalName":"test.txt",...}}`

```bash
# Test dashboard data
curl http://localhost:4000/data
```
Expected: `{"totalLogsToday":1,"successCount":1,"activeServers":1,"activeAlerts":1}`

```bash
# View all uploaded files
curl http://localhost:4000/files
```
Expected: `{"files":[...],"stats":{"totalFiles":1,"totalSize":1234,...}}`

**Impact / Risks:**
- ‚úÖ File upload now works correctly
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows real, consistent data
- ‚úÖ Users can track their uploads properly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data lost on server restart (will be fixed with database in Step 2)

**Follow-ups / TODO:**
- Phase A ¬∑ Step 2: Database models & indexes (persistent storage)
- Add file deletion functionality
- Implement file type validation
- Add file preview capabilities
